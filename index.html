    <h1>What is a micro-market?</h1>
    <p>A micro-market is an unmanned retail space where individuals can purchase food and beverages. Itâ€™s a convenience store inside your break room! Think freshly prepared lunches, healthy snacks, and drinks that people can access whenever the mood strikes. They are popular additions to employee break rooms, where they can be custom-fit to the size and shape of the area and packed with enticing options to keep employees both happy and healthy.</p>

    <h1>What are the Benefits?</h1>
    <p>Micro-markets offer a variety of nutritious and healthy foods for our customers. Micro-markets also give employees the ability to look at nutritional content before they make a purchase. This allows them to choose what products are right for them. One of the best features of a micro-market is not only the convenience of accessible, healthy food items, but the fact that they are self-serve, and do not require any additional manpower to serve employees.</p>

    <h1>How it Works</h1>
    <p>To use a micro-market, the customer simply picks up the food or beverage they wish to purchase and then pays for the items at the intuitive, self-checkout kiosk. As you pass things you want you just pick them up.</p>
    <p>After micro-market patrons have made their selections, they check themselves out using a self-serve kiosk.</p>
